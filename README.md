# Dinder
Users create an join session where they are given restaurants within a predefined traveling radius to swipe left or right on in a Tinder like user interface. After the timed session concludes, the liked restaurants are aggregated, and the most liked restaurant is chosen and shown to the user. 

## Install
- install cocoapods 
- launch the xcode project from `Dinder.xcworkspace`
- build for chosen device. Ipads are untested. 
- The api key used to obtain restaurants local to the user has been deleted for security purposes. Testing the swipeable restaurant cards would require replacing this api key.
